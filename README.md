# CaKnow-COCO-ontology
CaKnow is a domain-independent ontology based on the COCO dataset designed to represent and connect information from visual datasets like COCO, Visual Genome, and Flickr30K. It addresses the challenge of the semantic gap by linking objects and context through semantic relationships. CaKnow enables the construction of knowledge graphs from visual datasets, offering a structured way to query and understand image attributes, object classes, and metadata. It also connects to the Linked Open Data Cloud, integrating with the broader Web of Data.
